https://careers.foondamate.com/software-engineer-backend-remote/foondamate-software-engineer-coding-challenge-001

# Installation

This project was made and runs on Python 3.9.5.
 You will need:
Python 3.9.5 or better and have  requests and matplotlib install
```bash
pip install requests
```
```bash 
pip install matplotlib
```
# About

This is a CLI application that uses the matplotlib library to plot the data in a line graph format and uses the requests library to get the data from the API. When using 
the application, the application will ask if the user would like to filter the data which would allow a filter from start date to end date giving all data in between
the alocated dates or unfiltered showing all the data in one graph.
